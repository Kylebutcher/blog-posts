# Blogging App

## Description

This is my first blogging app. as of right now there is not much styling to it as i had military obligations to fulfill so i unfortunately have to turn it in as is. I tried to get all of the requirements for the project. However, this app allows you to enter your username and blog title and blog content. When you have completed and entered in the fields the app will then bring you to your page with all of the blog posts that you have made while in that session. The app also has a light mode and a dark mode!
